# Restaurant-Page
Project: Restaurant Page from Odin Project

Still practicing DOM manipulation and now first time learning webpack, npm and other cool stuff conncted with those. I fooled around with webpack alot and tested different stuff like npm run watch and npm start. Also practiced using imports for images and fonts and scripts.

Also my first website that looks decent on mobile.

-Negatives:
Bit slow, likely due to high quality images
